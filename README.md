UMass Boston

Requirements
---------

TexLive 2019 or newer (or, on macOS, MacTex 2019 or newer); or, a comparably recent version of MikTeX or of some other LaTeX distribution (such as proTeXt).

If using TeXLive or MacTeX, you can check your distribution version using the following steps. First, open a terminal window (directions: [Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows), [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-az/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)). Then, on the command line in the terminal, type

`pdflatex --version`

and press enter.

There will be several lines of output, but we are only interested in the first one. It should be something like

`pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.26 (TeX Live 2024)`

In this case, the TeXLive version would be 2024.

If your LaTeX distribution is too old, please update it. Directions: [MikTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console) (Windows); [MacTex](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/688954/mactex-upgrade-from-2022-to-2023) (macOS); [TeXLive](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/543284/kile-or-any-tex-software-cannot-find-tex-live-binaries-manually-installed-wh/736182#736182) (Linux).

If you are unable to update it, consider using [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). For most people, the free version should be sufficient. However, if you anticipate that your thesis or dissertation will be several hundreds of pages long and/or contain many large (in terms of file sizes) images, you may need a paid version.

I don't provide a direct link because it changes too frequently; Google is our best bet to find it reliably.)
