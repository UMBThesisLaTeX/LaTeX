Purpose
-------

Producing a master's thesis or a doctoral dissertation in LaTeX.

Requirements
---------

TexLive 2023 or newer.

TeXLive is the LaTeX distribution that underlies both MikTeX (on Windows) and TeXShop (on macOS).

To check your TeXLive version, open a terminal window (directions: [Windows](https://www.wikihow.com/Open-Terminal-in-Windows), [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-az/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)) and type

`pdflatex --version`

There will be several lines of output, but we are only interested in the first one. It should be something like

`pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.26 (TeX Live 2024)`

In this case, the TeXLive version would be 2024.

If your TeXLive version is too old, please update it ([directions](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/55437/how-do-i-update-my-tex-distribution)).

If you are unable to update it, consider using [OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). For most people, the free version should be sufficient. However, if you anticipate that your thesis or dissertation will be several hundreds of pages long and/or contain many large (in terms of file sizes) images, you may need a paid version.
